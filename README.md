## printf()
The printf project is a collaboration between Polymath Universata and Rahab Uwamohoro, actual students of Software Engineering at ALX, were a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. Its prototype is the following:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Where **format** contains the string that is printed. As _printf() is variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.

The format tags prototype is the following:

	%[flags][length]specifier

If the program runs successfully, the **return value** is the amount of chars printed.

| Specifier | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| c  | Character  |
| d or i | Signed decimal integer |
| s  | String of characters  |
| b  | Signed binary  |
| o  | Signed octal  |
| u  | Unsigned integer  |
| x  | Unsigned hexadecimal  |
| X  | Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase)  |
| p  | Pointer address  |
| r  | Reverse string of characters |
| R  | ROT13 translation of string |
| S  | String with special chars replaced by their ASCII value  |
| %  | Character  |

| Flags | Description | Specifiers |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| +  | Prints a plus sign (+) when the argument is a positive number. In other case, prints a minus sign (-). | i, d |
| (space) | Prints a blank space if the argument is a positive number | i, d |
| #  | Prints 0, 0x and 0X for o, x and X specifiers, respectively. It doesn't print anything if the argument is zero | o, x, X |

| Length | Description | Specifiers |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| l | Prints a long int or unsigned long int | i, d, o, u, x and X |
| h | Prints a short int or unsigned short int | i, d, o, u, x and X |
